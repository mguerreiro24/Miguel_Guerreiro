						A difficult estimate to reach with cephalopods is their total biomass and energy portion in the ecosystem, as well as their nutritional content (Machovsky-Capuska & Raubenheimer, 2020). For this, a biochemical characterization of each species (and with a special focus on the carbon content) can inform on the amount of live biomass present in these animals when added to the distribution and population density of them . Also, with this information, it is possible to interpolate the amount of carbon and energy (and at which rate) is being consumed by the animals, and how much is being provided to its predators.

						Cephalopods are difficult animals to study through normal means of sampling, as they actively avoid nets that are efficient for fish, have few hard organs or gas bladders that can easily show in acoustic survey and furthermore and they actively allude visual observation, by means of advanced camouflage or a shy and wary behavior. Therefore, research must employ different methodologies that do not rely on directly observing or obtaining the cephalopod in its natural environment.
					</p>
					<p>
						In ecology, the most difficult answer to retrieve from these animals is its location, due to the before mentioned difficulty. Several environmental as well as geolocated species observations databases are available, that if carefully run through algorithms, can provide us models of distribution and niche. Species distribution models (SDMs, also known as ecological niche models) work with such information and algorithms, relating presence and / or abundance data of species to environmental predictors. The most common applications of these models include determining suitable habitat sites for species, evaluating the invasive potential of species, and predicting the potential impacts of future climate change scenarios on species distributions.
					</p>
					<p>
						With this project, I plan to build such models, and predict the distribution of cephalpods within the Macaronesian region.

						as the digestive pre-processing of prey by cephalopods implies the partial to total physical destruction of food items, as the powerful beaks tear the food apart and the radula further macerates what is left of the meal, rendering it close to impossible the task of identifying the prey.
					</p>
					<p>
						However, these animals may look advanced, they normally do not reach the top of the food chain nor live very long. They are in a disadvantage towards fish when it comes to swimming , their early life is vulnerable to predators (even for the largest of cephalopods); hence, they serve many times as prey to many top predators in the ocean, and feed on many lower level prey which otherwise would not be available so readily to their predators. Cephalopods are characterized by a “live fast, die young” strategy (semelparity), showing some of the highest nutrient absorption rates in the animal kingdom and a young death after spawning for the first time (in a mere two years after being born).
