						A difficult estimate to reach with cephalopods is their total biomass and energy portion in the ecosystem, as well as their nutritional content (Machovsky-Capuska & Raubenheimer, 2020). For this, a biochemical characterization of each species (and with a special focus on the carbon content) can inform on the amount of live biomass present in these animals when added to the distribution and population density of them . Also, with this information, it is possible to interpolate the amount of carbon and energy (and at which rate) is being consumed by the animals, and how much is being provided to its predators.

						There are several species of squid and octopus that live in the open ocean. Some of these - either because they live close to the surface, or being positively boyant - when they die (or dying), they float at the surface of the ocean, where they provide nourishment to surface animals.
					</p>
					<p>
						I am interested in these animals for my research, as not only they provide georeferenced observations of species rarely seen, but also, a route for carbon stored in these animals alternative to ending in the bottom of the ocean.
					</p>
					<p>
						If you see such an animal, please take a picture and the gps coordinates and <a href="../contacts.html">contact me</a>. If possible, collect it and bring it to shore where I (or a colleague) will be retreaving it.

						<h2>Species Distribution of Cephalopods</h2>

				<div class="cd-project-info">
					<p>
						Cephalopods are difficult animals to study through normal means of sampling, as they actively avoid nets, have few hard organs or gas bladders that can show in acoustic survey and they actively allude visual observation, by means of advanced camouflage or a shy and wary behavior. Therefore, research must employ different methodologies that do not rely on directly observing or obtaining cephalopods in their natural environment.
					</p>
					<p>
						In ecology, the most difficult answer to retrieve from these animals is their location, due to the before mentioned difficulty. Several environmental as well as geolocated species observations databases are available, that if carefully run through algorithms, can provide us models of distribution and niche. Species distribution models (SDMs, also known as ecological niche models) work with such information and algorithms, relating presence and / or abundance data of species to environmental predictors. The most common applications of these models include determining suitable habitat sites for species, evaluating the invasive potential of species, and predicting the potential impacts of future climate change scenarios on species distributions.
					</p>
					<p>
						With this project, I plan to build such models, and predict the distribution of cephalpods within the Macaronesian region.

						Cephalopods are some of the dominant predators of the mesopelagic realm (the layer of the ocean between 200 and 500 m). Their diet is difficult to study, as their digestive pre-processing of prey implies the partial to total physical destruction of food items, as their powerful beaks tear the food apart and the radula (teethed tongue) further macerates what is left of the meal, rendering it close to impossible the task of identifying the prey.
					</p>
					<p>
						Although important predators of the deep, cephalopods normally do not reach the top of the food chain. Their early life is vulnerable to predators (even for the largest of cephalopods), hence, they serve many times as prey to many top predators in the ocean, and feed on many lower level prey which otherwise would not be available so readily to the cephalopod predators.
					</p>
					<p>
					 	Cephalopods are characterized by a “live fast, die young” strategy (semelparity), showing some of the highest nutrient absorption rates in the animal kingdom and a young death after spawning for the first time (around two years after hatching). This leads to mass post spawning mortality events, where dead spent adults cover the seabottom, providing a pulse of carbon to the local benthonic communities.
					 </p>
					 <p>
					 	With this project, I intend to better understand the role of cephalopods in the macaronesia, and their importance to the pelagic ecossystem.
