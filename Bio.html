                <p class="text">My name is Miguel Guerreiro, and I am currently working in the Deep sea Ecology group with Henk-Jan.</p>
                <p>I am a PhD student from Portugal, where I studied Marine Ecology (Msc) and also Bioinformatics & Computational Biology(Msc) which I finished in Vienna (Austria) and there worked as the Microbial Oceanography lab's bioinformatician. With the Deep sea ecology group here and RLab(MARE) in Lisbon, I am developing my PhD in Marine Ecology, with the aim of understanding and modelling the carbon pool and contribution to the biological pump that Cephalopods (squids, octopus and co.) are responsible for. In other words, I am trying to describe the role of Cephalopods as a carbon sink, as they are important animals in the Ocean - both as prey (Seabirds and Marine Mammals) and predator - contributing into a bigger living carbon pool in the Ocean (and less in the atmosphere), and most importantly, their life strategy of "live fast die young", makes their populations very abundant and flexible to their surroundings, and so, when they spawn and die, huge amounts of them sink into the bottom of the ocean where they become a feast to the seabed dwellers which trap this carbon for thousands of years.</p>
